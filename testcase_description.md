# Test Case Description

Every test case will use the API to get a list of movies according to certain parameters (filtering, page number, ...).
The result of the API call would be compared to a reference result, in the case where the database of the website did not change, but of course this is unlikely to be the case. As such, the results will instead be check of coherence (do the movies we get correspond to the criteria we used to filter ?).

## Component integration tests
- A few test cases that make queries that are the union of two or more of the previous test cases
- A few test cases that make several queries of the previous test cases in a row

## Performance tests

- Measure response time on a query that returns every movie
- Measure response time on a query for page 10000
